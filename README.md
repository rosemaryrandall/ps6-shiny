Repository for PS6 (INFO201)

I used data on bike rental rates in Seoul, South Korea from the UC Irvine online Machine Learning
Repository, and examined the impact of precipitation in the form of rainfall on bike rental rates. 
I did this using a scatterplot with a linear regression to determine the correlation between the two,
and included a random sample table for a user to see all the data being analyzed.
